/==/.Who are you?
Mythos:[@]I am Mythos of the[@]Metalimnion Conclave.
Mythos:[@]I work here as a historian.
Mythos:[@]And also do taxes.
Mythos:[@]Feel free to ask me any[@]questions you might have about Metalimnion.

/==/.Metalimnion
Mythos:[@]Metalimnion is, put simply,[@]a location coexisting on two realms[@]at once.
Mythos:[@]Not just here, but all of the[@]world's overlaps are metalimnions.
Mythos:[@]The Metalmnion Conclave is a[@]centeralized organization that controls[@]travel between realms through metalimnions.
Mythos:[@]The Metalmnions are theorized to[@]have formed from the Finis Event of[@]2300 AD.
Mythos:[@]With the restructuring of the Earth[@]in becoming the New Realm, the threads[@]between realms was weakened, allowing[@]places such as this to be formed[@]between the gaps.
Mythos:[@]Think of it like a wall between two[@]houses: the wall was destroyed and left[@]a hole in the ground. That hole was[@]then covered with a small bridge, allowing[@]travel between both houses.
Mythos:[@]In this, the houses are realms and[@]the bridge is Metalimnion.
Mythos:[@]The bridge isn't a house, though[@]it contains some elements of what is[@]in a house.
Mythos:[@]Metalimnion isn't its own realm,[@]but you can still use it to travel between[@]different realms.
Mythos:[@]Specifically, Metalimnion is[@]partially in all of the realms[@]that it connects.
Mythos:[@]After all, a bridge must be[@]connected with whatever it's[@]connecting.

/==/.Realms
Mythos:[@]Realms are basically different[@]locations that you normally can't travel[@]between.
Mythos:[@]Why they even exist is currently[@]unknown, but some special circumstances,[@]such as Metalimnion, allow for Realm travel.
Mythos:[@]The realm that us Manarians and[@]Lunarians come from is the Surface Realm.

/==/.Timelines
Mythos:[@]Timelines are similar to Realms,[@]but are a bit more complicated.
Mythos:[@]So like, think about what would[@]happen if you traveled back in time.
Mythos:[@]If you traveled back to time and[@]changed the past, how would the events[@]leading up to your life have changed?
Mythos:[@]Would it even be possible that[@]you'd exist?
Mythos:[@]It would be impossible to travel[@]back in time.
Mythos:[@]Except it isn't.
Mythos:[@]Enter the timelines.
Mythos:[@]Say that you are in year 200,[@]and you want to travel to[@]year 100.
Mythos:[@]When you travel from 200 to 100,[@]you cause a new timeline to form[@]starting from year 100 of that[@]original timeline.
Mythos:[@]Every event up until year 100 of[@]the new timeline would be the[@]same as the old timeline, but now the[@]events afterwards will change because you've[@]entered it and turned it into an alternate[@]timeline.
Mythos:[@]So now, there is a timeline that's[@]in year 200, and also one that's in[@]year 100.
Mythos:[@]Since you opened the new one while[@]it was year 200 in the old timeline, the[@]new timeline is running parallel to the old one[@]in year 100.
Mythos:[@]What I mean by this is that it is[@]year 200 in the old timeline while the new[@]one is in year 100.
Mythos:[@]So this would mean that in year 450[@]of the old timeline, it would be year 350[@]in the new timeline.
Mythos:[@]Of course, the events that happen in[@]this years will be different since you've[@]changed the future. But you get[@]what I mean.
Mythos:[@]If one is somehow able to travel[@]between timelines, they can essentially move[@]between two different universes.
Mythos:[@]This is why alternate timelines are[@]sometimes called Alternate Universes, or AUs.
Mythos:[@]As you've likely guessed by now,[@]each timeline has their own realms; realms are[@]not shared between AUs.
Mythos:[@]Realms are just locations after all,[@]you'd expect your house to exist in both[@]timelines if you opened one up to a day ago.
Mythos:[@]If you want a more technical explanation,[@]ask me about AUs and PUs.

/==/.AUs/PUs
Mythos:[@]This will get very complicated.
Mythos:[@]New alternate timelines don't just[@]come out from nowhere.
Mythos:[@]There's actually an infinite amount[@]of dormant parallel universes running[@]alongside any given timeline.
Mythos:[@]We call these PUs.
Mythos:[@]When a new timeline is formed,[@]a PU is converted into an AU.
Mythos:[@]This new AU, after an infinitely[@]small amount of time larger than 0 passes,[@]gains its own infinite amount of parallel PUs.
Mythos:[@]This is because it has now defined[@]itself as its own unique timeline and not[@]just a PU.
Mythos:[@]This process is called PU-AU Conversion,[@]or P-AC.
Mythos:[@]However, during the infinitely small[@]amount of time larger than 0 between[@]when the PU will be turned to an AU[@]and when it actually becomes a AU from[@]the unique diverging event (usually something[@]entering it), the timeline is stuck in a strange[@]state called a Indivertible P-AC State, or[@]IP-ACS.
Mythos:[@]With an IP-ACS, the PU hasn't defined[@]itself as its own AU yet, but the decision[@]to do so has been put into motion.
Mythos:[@]Now, how does this relate to literally[@]anything that you need to know?
Mythos:[@]It doesn't.

/==/.Humphrey
Mythos:[@]Humphrey Fallen is one of the only Realmer[@]survivors of the Finis Event.
Mythos:[@]He's also a pretty high ranking member of[@]the Metalimnion Conclave.
Mythos:[@]Humphrey set up this quest for you, and[@]you'll get to meet him if you get a key[@]from the Ricefield Realm and Shadow Realm.
