/==/.Metalimnion
Mythos:[@]Metalimnion is, put simply,[@]a location coexisting on two realms[@]at once.
Mythos:[@]Not just here, but all of the[@]world's overlaps are metalimnions.
Mythos:[@]The Metalmnion Conclave is a[@]centeralized organization that controls[@]travel between realms through metalimnions.
Mythos:[@]The Metalmnions are theorized to[@]have formed from the Finis Event of[@]2300 AD.
Mythos:[@]With the restructuring of the Earth[@]in becoming the New Realm, the threads[@]between realms was weakened, allowing[@]places such as this to be formed[@]between the gaps.
Mythos:[@]Think of it like a wall between two[@]houses: the wall was destroyed and left[@]a hole in the ground. That hole was[@]then covered with a small bridge, allowing[@]travel between both houses.
Mythos:[@]In this, the houses are realms and[@]the bridge is Metalimnion.
Mythos:[@]The bridge isn't a house, though[@]it contains some elements of what is[@]in a house.
Mythos:[@]Metalimnion isn't its own realm,[@]but you can still use it to travel between[@]different realms.
Mythos:[@]Specifically, Metalimnion is[@]partially in all of the realms[@]that it connects.
Mythos:[@]After all, a bridge must be[@]connected with whatever it's[@]connecting.

/==/.Realms
Mythos:[@]Realms are basically different[@]locations that you normally can't travel[@]between.
Mythos:[@]Why they even exist is currently[@]unknown, but some special circumstances,[@]such as Metalimnion, allow for Realm travel.
