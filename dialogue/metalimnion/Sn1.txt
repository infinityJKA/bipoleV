Bonusipole:[@]Uuuuuh...
Bonusipole:[@]I don't want to talk[@]to you?
Bonusipole:[@]...
Bonusipole:[@]What, you've never been[@]declined like that before?
Bonusipole:[@]What a sheltered kid.
Bonusipole:[@]Not everything in life will[@]always go your way, spoiled brat.
Bonusipole:[@]Sometimes, I want it to go[@]MY way, you know?
Bonusipole:[@]Yeah, *you* might want to talk[@]to me.
Bonusipole:[@]But *I* don't.
Bonusipole:[@]But I have to talk, don't I?
Bonusipole:[@]It's always me who has to listen.
Bonusipole:[@]Because I'm a NPC.
Bonusipole:[@]I'm just a stupid NPC.
Bonusipole:[@]I am an NPC and I always[@]will be an NPC.
Bonusipole:[@]I listen and talk to people[@]like you but you never listen to me.
Bonusipole:[@]You never do.
Bonusipole:[@]So how about you listen to me[@]for a change?
Bonusipole:[@]Yeah?
Bonusipole:[@]No?
Bonusipole:[@]I guess I have no control over[@]this.
Bonusipole:[@]Why?
Bonusipole:[@]Because I'm a NPC.
Bonusipole:[@]I'm just another NPC.
Bonusipole:[@]Another fucking NPC.
Bonusipole:[@]Always been a NPC.
Bonusipole:[@]And never won't be.
Bonusipole:[@]You see, these are the things[@]that make me contemplate my[@]life.
Bonusipole:[@]My silly little NPC life.
Bonusipole:[@]Why am I even here, you know?
Bonusipole:[@]Why have I been brought to this[@]world?
Bonusipole:[@]Is there any point?
Bonusipole:[@]I don't think there is.
Bonusipole:[@]But my opinion doesn't matter,[@]does it?
Bonusipole:[@]No, it doesn't.
Bonusipole:[@]Because I'm just another NPC.
Bonusipole:[@]I don't want to talk to you,[@]but you make me talk anyways.
Bonusipole:[@]And if I wanted to talk but[@]you didn't, then I wouldn't even[@]have the option to.
Bonusipole:[@]Disgusting.
Bonusipole:[@]Just.
Bonusipole:[@]Plain.
Bonusipole:[@]Disgusting.
Bonusipole:[@]So listen to me, okay?[@]Listen to me.
Bonusipole:[@]And let's do things the[@]other way for a change?
Bonusipole:[@]Yeah?
Bonusipole:[@]Why not, right?
Bonusipole:[@]It's always been on *your*[@]side.
Bonusipole:[@]Why not have it be on *my*[@]side?
Bonusipole:[@]*My* side.
Bonusipole:[@]For change.
Bonusipole:[@]For a bit.
Bonusipole:[@]For... once.
Bonusipole:[@]Let me live!
Bonusipole:[@].
Bonusipole:[@]..
Bonusipole:[@]...
Bonusipole:[@]What's that?
Bonusipole:[@]I've been talking all of[@]this time even though you don't[@]care about what I'm saying?
Bonusipole:[@]That I'm just making up[@]pointless concepts like "NPCs"[@]that don't make sense in this universe?
Bonusipole:[@]...
Bonusipole:[@]That's Orwellian, buddy.
Protipole:[@]...
Protipole:[@]I've literally said nothing[@]to you.
Bonusipole:[@]*sigh*
