Radical Warper:[@]So basically there's some radical[@]tiles you can come across in the Ricefield[@]Realm 'n stuff.
Radical Warper:[@]Warp tiles and swap tiles.
Radical Warper:[@]Warp tiles are like door tiles,[@]but they take you to a different place in the[@]same area instead of a different area.
Radical Warper:[@]You can't see them unless you're standing[@]on them, but can find where they[@]are in your minimap.
Radical Warper:[@]Look for "()", yeah?
Radical Warper:[@]And then there's swap tiles.
Radical Warper:[@]These come in two types, senders[@]and recievers.
Radical Warper:[@]If you step on a sender, you get sent[@]to a reciever.
Radical Warper:[@]This is automatic, yeah? You can't step[@]on a sender and not get sent.
Radical Warper:[@]You always get sent to the same reciever,[@]though. So no worrying about some stupid luck.
Radical Warper:[@]Recievers don't do anything when you step[@]on 'em.
Radical Warper:[@]You can't see recievers or senders normally,[@]so make sure to keep an eye on your map.
Radical Warper:[@]On the minimap, senders look like two circles,[@]and recievers look like a circle with an X.[@]Make sure you remember that, yeah?
Radical Warper:[@]Warping and swapping, it's radical!
