Kai:[@]So you've arrived...
Kai:[@]I'm impressed.
Kai:[@]I am Kai, you should[@]know me well by now.
Kai:[@]However, this whole game[@]wasn't orchestrated by me.
Kai:[@]No, it was him.
Kai:[@]The man that cursed Radio.
Kai:[@]He awaits up ahead and[@]wishes to test your strength.
Kai:[@]Do not underestimate him.
Kai:[@]Life is just a game to him.
Kai:[@]This very realm in which[@]we now stand within is but[@]a temporary realm created by[@]him.
Kai:[@]To even damage his barriers,[@]you'll need to use an ultimate[@]weapon.
Kai:[@]...
Kai:[@]I wish you luck.
