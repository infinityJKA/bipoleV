The New Link:[@]Hello, mortal Realmer.
The New Link:[@]It seem you've finally arrived.
The New Link:[@]I've been waiting a while for this[@]game to come to an end.
The New Link:[@]And a long wait it has been.
The New Link:[@]Yes, I was the one who revealed the[@]location of the Holy Cards.
The New Link:[@]I did so to both Bieace and Eviole[@]after I took the Cards of Death for[@]myself.
The New Link:[@]And you've come out on top.
The New Link:[@]And as well as that, you've survived[@]the Riecfield Realm and the Alter[@]Realm.
The New Link:[@]This will be a fun battle...
