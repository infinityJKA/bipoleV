Raidiole:[@]Hey!
Raidiole:[@]Who the hell are you?
Raidiole:[@]If you're trying to get[@]the Holy Cards, we might[@]have a issue.
Raidiole:[@]You, see... I'm Raidiole,[@]the commander of the god damn[@]Empire of Eviole.
Raidiole:[@]And I want those Holy Cards.
Raidiole:[@]I don't know if that message[@]in my castle was a prank, but it[@]makes enough sense for me to listen[@]to it!
Protipole:[@]There was a message on your[@]castle as well?
Raidiole:[@]Yep, and it was signed by some[@]guy called "The New Link".
Raidiole:[@]Now I don't know what a "Link"[@]is and why it's "New"...
Raidiole:[@]But I do know how to fight.
Raidiole:[@]And since you're also trying to[@]find the cards...

Raidiole:[@]We've got a little situaton.
Raidiole:[@]And I know that girl downstairs[@]said to not mess this place up...
#SET_BIG_IMAGE raidiole
Raidiole:[@]But I like a little gunplay.

Raidiole:[@]Damn damn damn bro, you didn't[@]have to hurt me like that.
Raidiole:[@]...
Raidiole:[@]Shit.
Raidiole:[@]I really want those Holy Cards...
Raidiole:[@]But I'm probably going to die[@]if I keep fighting...
Raidiole:[@]...
Raidiole:[@]I must make a strategic retreat...
