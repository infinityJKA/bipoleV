/==/.Who are you?
Dyad Distichouan:[@]I am Dyad Distichouan,[@]second luminary of the Antediluvian[@]Sacrosanct Agglomerate.
Dyad Distichouan:[@]It seems I am one of the few[@]humans left in this world, if you[@]could call me that in my state.

/==/.Antediluvian Sacrosanct Agglomerate
Dyad Distichouan:[@]The Antediluvian Sacrosanct Agglomerate[@]is a secret society formed prior to the[@]Finis Event, in which we tried to become God.
Dyad Distichouan:[@]The group consisted of five "Luminaries".
Dyad Distichouan:[@]Ark Primo, the First Luminary.
Dyad Distichouan:[@]Ternion Triumvir, the Third Luminary
Dyad Distichouan:[@]Tetra Quadrumvirate, the Fourth Luminary
Dyad Distichouan:[@]Lustrum Quincunx, the Fifth Luminary.
Dyad Distichouan:[@]I was the Second Luminary.
Dyad Distichouan:[@]In order to ascend, we utilized the[@]newly-developed CELL technology and[@]cybernetics to augment our bodies.
Dyad Distichouan:[@]In doing so, we essentially became gods[@]among men, at least in terms of strength.
Dyad Distichouan:[@]We worked directly with Evan Levi and[@]the Leviathan in order to assure our placement[@]on Luna before the Finis Event occured.
Dyad Distichouan:[@]After the Finis Event, though, Ark[@]Primo had somehow been killed.
Dyad Distichouan:[@]This caused conflict between the[@]remaining members and fighting broke out.
Dyad Distichouan:[@]The only thing keeping us together[@]was our common goal of godhood, so it was[@]inevitable conflict would happen[@]eventually.
Dyad Distichouan:[@]With Ark's death, however, we were[@]unable to reach the power we had[@]planned to obtain, and our ascention[@]plan ultimately failed.
Dyad Distichouan:[@]As for me, I'm finished with attempting[@]the ascention plan.
Dyad Distichouan:[@]I've already become stronger than most[@]other mortals, and I don't want to risk[@]my life fighting the other luminaries.
Dyad Distichouan:[@]Anyhow, being able to freely experience[@]life is more than enough of a satisfaction[@]for me.
Dyad Distichouan:[@]I only wanted to become God for the freedom.

/==/.Evan Levi
Dyad Distichouan:[@]Evan was the founder of the[@]Leviathan, all the way back since[@]22nd century.
Dyad Distichouan:[@]He made himself essentially immortal[@]through using CELL technology[@]and cybernetics, similar to how we[@]did in the ASA.
Dyad Distichouan:[@]Evan's power wasn't as strong as ours[@]though, and we were able to threaten[@]him into having some power in the Leviathan.
Dyad Distichouan:[@]He would build us a base in Luna, and in[@]return we would gurantee his safety[@]until the Finis Event and gave him a[@]little of our more advanced CELL technology.

/==/.The Finis Event
Dyad Distichouan:[@]Evan's plan with the Finis Event was[@]to incite a Time of Judgement upon the realm[@]in order to eradicate most of humanity and[@]create a new world of destruction as a[@]punishment for humanity's sins.
Dyad Distichouan:[@]However, this plan didn't fully work.
Dyad Distichouan:[@]A human known as Canvas almost killed[@]Evan when he was starting the Finis Event.
Dyad Distichouan:[@]This caused the Nexters to see hope and[@]worth in the future of humanity, and[@]intervened with the event.
Dyad Distichouan:[@]Earth's lands were shifted and all[@]Realmers on the planet gained natural Mana[@]capabilities.
Dyad Distichouan:[@]So now, humanity was split between two[@]species, the Lunarians who gained no[@]new traits from the Finis Event, and then[@]the Manatians such as you.
Dyad Distichouan:[@]Manatians have the natural ability to[@]generate and control Mana, the energy[@]used to perform magic spells.
Dyad Distichouan:[@]The control of mana also brought way[@]to the natural use of Magica, the physical[@]manifestation of Mana energy, used[@]most often in conjuration.
Dyad Distichouan:[@]This also led to the creation of[@]Magica-based lifeforms created upon the[@]Earth by the Nexters following the Finis[@]Event, such as slimes.
Dyad Distichouan:[@]The entities found in these ruins,[@]the Lesser Truthes, are different though.
Dyad Distichouan:[@]They are relics of the higher entities[@]from after the Finis Event from entities[@]involved in the recreation, such as the[@]Nexters and Previousers.
Dyad Distichouan:[@]A few select Realmers from the[@]Finis Event were chosen to be reincarnated[@]with a significantly more powerful, non-aging[@]form, such as Artxe here.

/==/.The Bonus Shop
Dyad Distichouan:[@]The Bonus Shop is a strange place.
Dyad Distichouan:[@]It isn't its own realm, but it isn't[@]fully in the New Realm either.
Dyad Distichouan:[@]Gates to it appear in strange places,[@]such as here in the Ruins of Time.
Dyad Distichouan:[@]The Ruins of Time seem to have a strong[@]disconnection from the rest of the[@]realm though, with the Lesser Truthes and[@]such.
Dyad Distichouan:[@]I originally discovered the Bonus Shop[@]when I was exploring Metalimnion, but it[@]was a different location of the Bonus Shop.
Dyad Distichouan:[@]If you ever enter Metalimnion, why not[@]try looking for it?
Dyad Distichouan:[@]To me, the Bonus Shop represents the[@]ultimate freeedom: not bound to one[@]realm but not restricted from[@]any either.
Dyad Distichouan:[@]Though its powers may be unexplainable,[@]its powers lead freedom and freedom[@]is the truth.
