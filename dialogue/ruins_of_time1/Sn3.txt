/==/.Antediluvian Sacrosanct Agglomerate
Dyad Distichouan:[@]The Antediluvian Sacrosanct Agglomerate[@]is a secret society formed prior to[@]the Finis Event, in which we tried to become God.
Dyad Distichouan:[@]The group consisted of five "Luminaries".
Dyad Distichouan:[@]Ark Primo, the First Luminary.
Dyad Distichouan:[@]Ternion Triumvir, the Third Luminary
Dyad Distichouan:[@]Tetra Quadrumvirate, the Fourth Luminary
Dyad Distichouan:[@]Lustrum Quincunx, the Fifth Luminary.
Dyad Distichouan:[@]I was the Second Luminary.
Dyad Distichouan:[@]In order to ascend, we utilized the[@]newly-developed CELL technology and cybernetics[@] to augment our bodies.
Dyad Distichouan:[@]In doing so, we essentially became[@]gods among men, at least in terms of strength.
Dyad Distichouan:[@]We worked directly with Evan Levi and[@]the Leviathan in order to assure our placement[@]on Luna before the Finis Event occured.
Dyad Distichouan:[@]After the Finis Event, though, Ark[@]Primo had somehow been killed.
Dyad Distichouan:[@]This caused conflict between the[@]remaining members and fighting broke out.
Dyad Distichouan:[@]The only thing keeping us together[@]was our common goal of godhood, so it[@]was inevitable conflict would happen eventually.
Dyad Distichouan:[@]With Ark's death, however, we were[@]unable to reach the power we had[@]planned to obtain, and our ascention[@]plan ultimately failed.
Dyad Distichouan:[@]As for me, I'm finished with attempting[@]the ascention plan.
Dyad Distichouan:[@]I've already become stronger than most[@]other mortals, and I don't want to risk[@]my life fighting the other luminaries.
Dyad Distichouan:[@]Anyhow, being able to freely experience[@]life is more than enough of a satisfaction[@]for me.
Dyad Distichouan:[@]I only wanted to become God for the freedom.
