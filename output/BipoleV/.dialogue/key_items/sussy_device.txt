The device smells of gunpowder,[@]blood, and nicotine.
Taking a closer look at it, a faint[@]ticking sound can be heard.
On the back is a smiley face sticker saying:[@]"Every mortal will eventually die,[@]all of your actions will eventually be[@]forgotten to the passage of times and[@]evidence of your existence will vanish[@]as if you had never lived!"
Turning the device over, the bottom reveals[@]an another sticker, this time of an[@]urinating cartoon character.
