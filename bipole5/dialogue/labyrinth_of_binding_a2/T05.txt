Quondam:[@]Hello, I'm Eidola's ex-boyfriend.
Quondam:[@]We dated back before she somehow[@]become a necromancer, but we broke up.
Quondam:[@]And then I died from disease at[@]the age of 22.
Quondam:[@]After she became a necromancer,[@]she specifically went out of her way to[@]go to my grave and revive me just to[@]enslave me.
Quondam:[@]Like I'm literally the only one[@]here who wasn't buried here in the Labyrinth[@]of Binding.
Quondam:[@]All of these old people buried[@]here centuries ago terrify me.
Quondam:[@]You know, I should've stayed[@]a virgin.
Quondam:[@]Kid, have some self-respect for[@]yourself and listen to my advice.
Quondam:[@]Don't hang out with a girl who's[@]going to become a necromantic dictator.

Protipole:[@]Hey, if you regret losing your[@]virginity, could you sign this?
Quondam:[@]Huh? What's this?
Protipole:[@]It's propaganda from the, er...[@]Virginatorz Movement.
Quondam:[@]That sounds stupid.
Quondam:[@]But I do really regret losing my[@]virginity...
Quondam:[@]Sure, I'll sign it.
(Quondam signs the Virginity Propaganda!)
