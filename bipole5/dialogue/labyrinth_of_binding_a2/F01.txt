Eidola:[@]Wow.
Eidola:[@]I'm popular today.
Eidola:[@]So many visitors.
Protipole:[@]Do you know where the[@]Holy Cards are?
Eidola:[@]You're the second one to[@]ask that today.
Eidola:[@]Honestly, I don't know.
Eidola:[@]But I probably have it.
Eidola:[@]There's a giant room full[@]of treasure on the third floor.
Eidola:[@]I don't really care about[@]treasure, I just want a[@]kingdom.
Eidola:[@]BUT...
Eidola:[@]You people can't just keep[@]coming in here to steal it from[@]me, you know?
Protipole:[@]I really need the Holy Cards.
Eidola:[@]Okay, if you want it so badly,[@]then how about you entertain me[@]for a bit?
Eidola:[@]If you're strong enough to[@]have an interesting battle,[@]I'll let you through.

Eidola:[@]Okay okay okay...
Eidola:[@]Stop fighting.
Eidola:[@]I don't want to destroy[@]my house.
Eidola:[@]I'll let you pass.
Eidola:[@]Be careful though, the guy[@]I let pass earlier is still there.
Eidola:[@]If you fight him, try not[@]to destroy my castle, okay?
