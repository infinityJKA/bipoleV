## Tips

Some helpful tips for getting started.

- **TALK TO EVERY NPC**: This is really important, many NPCs have extremely important things to say.
- **TAKE NOTES**: There are lots of things to keep track of in this game, take notes on enemy weaknesses, quests to complete, and areas to come back to later.
- **EXPLOIT ENEMY WEAKNESSES**: You will NOT be able to beat this game without doing this. The game is balanced around multiplying your damage, and you must build a specialized party to beat a each boss.
- **STATUS EFFECTS**: Don't ignore equipment that increase your stats or decrease enemy stats! These are important in beating bosses, and even allow you to beat bosses while underleveled if you're tactical enough.
- **THE ECONOMY**: If the game is too difficult, try exploiting the economy to afford more items and equipment. For an extra challenge in a second playthrough, try doing a run where you don't go out of your way to exploit the economy. The game's economic system can be ignored in a playthrough, but it provides a way for making the game a bit easier for those who spend the time to mess with it.
