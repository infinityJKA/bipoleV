/==/.How did you get your powers?
Eidola:[@]Okay, so I was basically just[@]living my life as usual.
Eidola:[@]And then this tall guy wearing[@]a weird mask appeared in my[@]room.
Eidola:[@]So I was really scared, since[@]I was daydreaming in my bedroom and was[@]caugh off-guard.
Eidola:[@]And then he takes some some strange[@]needle, right?
Eidola:[@]And then he grabs my arm and[@]tells me "you're probably going to die[@]from this."
Eidola:[@]So then I'm panicking, but I[@]can't stop him and he injects me with[@]the needle.
Eidola:[@]And the he just disappears.
Eidola:[@]Like completely gone in a second.
Eidola:[@]So I'm just left freaking out[@]there, and start to feel a bit weird[@]in the next few days.
Eidola:[@]I got really sick, but after[@]a week I recovered.
Eidola:[@]And then the mysterious guy[@]appeared in my room again.
Eidola:[@]I ask him what the hell he[@]did to me, and then he says something[@]about an "Unique Spell", "Alg Formation", and[@]some guy named "Break".
Eidola:[@]So then I pick up a knife and[@]I'm like "I'm going to kill you motherfucker",[@]but then he's like invincible.
Eidola:[@]Then he explains that I bascially[@]have superpowers now and then I'm like[@]"that's bullshit", but then I realized that I[@]have the power to bring back the dead.
Eidola:[@]And also I'm suddenly really[@]strong and really powerful with magic, and[@]I'd never used magic before that since I[@]didn't really care about it or have the[@]patience to learn it.
Eidola:[@]So then I realize something.
Eidola:[@]Up until then, I had been[@]low-ranking noble so I never[@]really have the luxuries of the higher-ups.
Eidola:[@]But with this power, I could[@]just make myself my own high noble[@]with a castle and servants.
Eidola:[@]So I find out there's this giant[@]labyrinth full of corpses, so then[@]I'm like "that's perfect" and moved here[@]and made it into my own personal paradise.
Eidola:[@]Everyone here listens to me and[@]does anything I say, and my Alg Form[@]or whatever made it so I have eternal youth,[@]so I have lot's of time to enjoy this perfect[@]life.

/==/.Why do you live here?
Eidola:[@]Well it's a big place, plenty[@]of space to walk around and have all[@]my stuff in.
Eidola:[@]It's also full of lots of old[@]corpses, so I turned them into my servants.
Ediola:[@]The labyrinth makes for a very[@]good castle.

/==/.Future
Eidola:[@]When I get bored of just[@]hanging out in this castle, I'll[@]probably a conquest.
Eidola:[@]Imagine, my very own skeletal[@]empire with me as the queen.
Eidola:[@]When I do that, I'll probably[@]build a brand-new castle outside,[@]like a giant one towering across the sky.
Eidola:[@]Everyone in the empire would[@]follow me because I'm so powerful and[@]my army can just get revived if defeated.
Eidola:[@]It'd be so cool.
Eidola:[@]And awesome.

/==/.The other person
Eidola:[@]Oh yeah, the guy who visted[@]today before you?
Eidola:[@]I think he's from the Empire[@]of Eviole.
Eidola:[@]Said he's looking for the Holy[@]Cards, just like you.
Eidola:[@]I don't even know what the Holy[@]Cards are, but they seem important.
Eidola:[@]You can take them though, just[@]don't mess up my castle.
