Tips:

	-TALK TO EVERY NPC. This is really important, many NPCs have extremely
		important things to say.
	-TAKE NOTES. There are lots of things to keep track of in this game,
		take notes on enemy weaknesses, quests to complete, and areas
		to come back to later.
	-EXPLOIT ENEMY WEAKNESSES. You will NOT be able to beat this game without
		doing this. The game is balanced around multiplying your damage,
		and you must build a specialized party to beat a each boss.
	-STATUS EFFECTS. Don't ignore equipment that increase your stats or
		decrease enemy stats! These are important in beating bosses,
		and even allow you to beat bosses while underleveled if you're
		tactical enough.
	-THE ECONOMY. If the game is too difficult, try exploiting the economy
		to afford more items and equipment. For an extra challenge in
		a second playthrough, try doing a run where you don't go out
		of your way to exploit the economy. The game's economic system
		can be ignored in a playthrough, but it provides a way for
		making the game a bit easier for those who spend the time
		to mess with it.
